	Topic: Gambling as a disorder
     	<Quotes> 
"CATR: Great. And so most people gamble from time to time and how do we know when (quote-unquote) normal gambling turns into something that’s disordered?
Dr. Fong: This is a question I get essentially, four or five times a week, when people will say, do I have a gambling addiction? Or how do I know if my husband or wife or son or daughter is going to develop a gambling addiction? And I usually start with the following. First, I tell people gambling is part of something we do every day in our lives. It’s risk-taking. It’s decision-making. It’s going for rewards.
Essentially, though, the difference is that between someone who gambles regularly and socially versus someone with a (quote) gambling disorder, or a gambling addiction is that if their gambling continues to bring harmful consequences to their lives and they continue to engage in gambling, that’s an addiction. Furthermore, men and women with gambling disorder, they experience all sorts of things that people who gamble recreationally do not. They have urges and cravings that get in the way of them completing their daily lives. They have restrictions and limitations [00:05:00] on what they can do in life because of the consequences of gambling.
So, much like any other addictive disorder, it isn’t so much how much you gamble or how often or how much you’ve lost, it’s what are the consequences and what are the biological and psychological and social experiences it is for the person who is gambling? If they gamble in a way that’s harmful and distressing and emotionally painful, that’s an addiction. If they gamble and they have a lot of fun and they lose a lot of money, but it doesn’t impact their daily functioning, that’s not an addiction. That’s just a hobby.
CATR: It sounds a lot like a substance use disorder. 
Dr. Fong: It is. In fact, it is, because gambling disorder now in 2023, and it really is going back to 2013 was moved from the impulse control disorders section into the substance-related and addictive disorders section in the DSM-5. For all the folks who want to look through the DSM-5, open up that chapter, “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorder”. You’ll see all the 11 substance use diagnosis criteria. Alcohol, tobacco, opioids, sedative hypnotics; and then you’ll see “Gambling Disorder” in the exact same section of addictive disorders. So, therefore, it is an addiction.
Now, we’ve called it in the past things like “process addictions,” “behavioral addictions.” My favorite is the neurologist who called it “hedonistic dysregulation syndrome.” But essentially, what this is an addictive disorder that does not involve the ingestion of substances. Instead, it’s the actual act of gambling that changes brain structure and functioning, that captures some of the biological risk. So, essentially, the experience they go through is exactly like one going through any other substance use disorder.
CATR: Why is it that gambling ended up in the addiction chapter in the DSM, but a lot of these other behavioral dysregulation disorders did not?
Dr. Fong: Well, I can give you the official answer or I can give you the unofficial answer. 
CATR: A little bit of both.
Dr. Fong: A little bit of both. So, when I was in medical school, DSM-4 1994, right? And when you were in medical school maybe a few years after that, DSM-5 came out in 2013. And for a long time the (quote) behavioral addictions lived in this section of Impulse Control Disorders – pathological gambling, trichotillomania, pyromania, kleptomania, intermittent explosive disorder. There was no video game addiction and there was no (quote) sex addiction.
But the science basically, from 1995 to 2010, let’s say, was really predominately focused on gambling. The gambling science showed us neuroimaging, genetic studies, biomarkers, medication trials that all were very similar to the field of substance use disorder. So, that was enough data to say, this looks and smells like an addictive disorder, that’s why we’re going to move it there. From 2013, the other (quote) behavioral addictions – internet gaming disorder, hypersexual addiction, shopping (if you want to call it) – none of them had the same level of scientific rigor, scientific study or any of the global understanding of what patients are going through, to say with confidence, you know what? This is actually an addiction.
So, nowadays we get this all the time. They say, well, aren’t all behavioral addictions like gambling the same? And that’s why we’re getting this crossover between internet gaming disorder, gambling disorder, and think about men and women who watch video games online, but don’t spend money, but they’re watching a slot machine simulator. Is that a gambling disorder or is that a gaming disorder or is that a YouTube disorder? 
So, the bottom line of what we’re getting at, these are emerging conditions of study that are super important, but gambling disorder and previously known as problem gambling, compulsive gambling, pathological gambling, is pretty certain now that it is an addictive disorder because of the science that we have accumulated.
CATR: And how common is it?
Dr. Fong: So, oftentimes when I ask this question to medical students, they think it’s super rare. Oh, maybe 1 in 10,000. Well, we know that lifetime prevalence rates of gambling disorder hovers around 1% to 2% of the general population. We also know that within the last 12 months, depending on where you are in America or across the world, that last year 12-month prevalence rate can be as high as 3% to 6% or as low as .1 to 1%. So, you put it all together, that sounds like bipolar disorder. It also sounds like schizophrenia, other significant serious mental illnesses.
So, we know that gambling disorder in terms of prevalence is something that’s not rare. It’s there [00:10:00] and it’s prevalent, it’s just not discussed. Why? Because we don’t screen for it? But more importantly, patients don’t like to talk about it. Think about the last time a patient came to your office with the chief complaint, I gambled excessively in a harmful way, and I need help to stop. That’s just not something comfortable for people to talk about.
CATR: And that’s just a societal restriction or stigma.
Dr. Fong: Definitely that, I think it goes back to how we view money. We think about people who have a lot of money, and we equate them with success, moral quality, things like that. And if you lose money, you are (quote) not only a loser financially, but you’re a loser personality-wise. So, that’s a harsh way of saying it because all the way back to kind of like the Puritan and Christian days of how the Unites States were founded where they viewed gambling as both a vice and possibly a sin, but also as a way of escalating your future fortunes.
CATR: So, if we are dealing with something that has a prevalence similar to bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, we screen all mental health patients for psychotic symptoms, manic symptoms. Should we be screening everybody for gambling disorder?
Dr. Fong: Well, absolutely. That’s an excellent rhetorical question. And the way I would phrase this is very simply. You go all the way back to medical school. You go all the way back to undergrad, you know, we learn about addiction very early on now in education – high schools and junior high, colleges, right? When we get to medical school we don’t spend a lot of time on addictions in general. And we don’t spend any time on behavioral addictions and things like this. And I think this is part of the story, when you don’t have people teaching about it and talking about it, of course, it’s not going to be put in.
There are also no clear reimbursement rates. There’s no mandatory screening guidelines set forth by SMSA or by NIDA or by NIH or even our organization, the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry that say it is standard of care to be screening for all addiction disorders, including gaming and gambling disorders. And I think about with suicide – I do this all the time with medical students. They say if you don’t ask for suicide, that’s malpractice. The med students accept that. They recognize that because they recognize the severity of self harm and suicidal thinking.
When it comes to gambling disorder because it’s been so under-recognized and under-studied over the last 40 years, it’s the hidden addiction. It’s a silent addiction. And you think about again what patients look like with gambling disorder and you close your mind’s eye, and you have a stereotype view of that. You can’t smell it. You can’t taste it. They can walk, they can talk, their balance is good, they’re not overdosing, they’re not psychotic, they’re not agitated, they’re not hostile. They’re distressed, but oftentimes you can’t see it.
One of the things I say all the time in these kinds of lectures is no one has died from gambling disorder where it’s listed on their death certificate. But unfortunately, many people have died because of the consequences of gambling disorder. Suicide rates are high, co-occurring psychiatric disorders are super high. So, the idea is yes, screening should be part of intake, but it also should be part of our annual kind of mental health checkup. And it should also be part of our differential when a patient is not responding to standard treatments. Standard treatments for depression or insomnia or anxiety or any other substance use disorder, they’re not doing well. They come, they just feel like they’re not improving it may be because of a gambling disorder underneath that’s not been recognized.
So, one of the easy ways of screening – I get this a lot when people say, it’s too much! You’ve got to ask about all of these other things. When do I actually get to talk to the patient? And I say to them, fold it into your intake or fold it into your first few sessions that you’re working with a client. And start off with something very simple. Well, tell me about how you spend your money on entertainment. Or over the last 12 months, have you ever spent money in a gambling setting such as a casino, a racetrack, or a mobile online? 
So, making it very clear, the good entry and then you can open up and ask them deeper questions. There are a very simple 3-item gambling questionnaire screener. You remember in med school, we had the CAGE for alcohol? So, we have a similar one for gambling called the BBGS – the Brief Biosocial Gambling Screen. And it’s just three items asking someone if they’ve lied about their gambling, if they’ve been preoccupied about it, if they’ve gambled more than they intended. But then it’s meant to open up a conversation where you then go through the DSM-5 criteria in a systematic way to get a good interview. 
So, again, a lot of patients [00:15:00] are fine when you ask. I think there’s also some hesitancy by a lot of doctors – well... Asking about money is a real personal thing. I’m not really comfortable about that. But that’s not the same way it was about asking about sexual history in the early ‘80’s. We have to do it. Nowadays, we have to do it and ask about money – not just gambling. Gambling’s a part of it. That’s why we have to recognize there are lots of other forms of gambling. The regulated brick-and-mortar casino experiences, the mobile sports betting, the financial technology gambling software. These are all elements of gambling that we should be asking about.

		"CATR: That sounds a lot like a substance use disorder (SUD)",
		"CATR: How common is gambling disorder?",
		"CATR: What are some important risk factors for gambling disorder?"
		], 

	answers: [
		"Dr. Fong: Gambling crosses into disordered territory when it results in harmful consequences. It’s not about how often you gamble, or even how much money you’ve lost, it’s more about the role that gambling has in your life. If you continue to gamble in a way that’s harmful and distressing and emotionally painful, that’s an addiction. People with gambling disorder will continue to gamble despite these consequences, and they’ll experience urges and cravings to gamble that interfere with and impair daily life.",
		"Dr. Fong: Historically, gambling disorder has been placed in many different categories: “process addiction,” “behavioral addiction,” and there was once a proposal for “hedonistic dysregulation syndrome,” which probably never caught on because it’s such a mouthful. But you’re right to point out the similarity to SUD, because it is an addictive disorder, just one that does not involve the ingestion of a substance. In fact, the DSM-5 moved gambling disorder from the impulse control disorders section into the substance-related and addictive disorders section for the 5th edition. So according to the DSM, at least as of 2013, gambling disorder is an addiction. That said, the science is always evolving and emerging technologies are making the distinction between various behavioral dysregulation disorders very fuzzy. We’re now seeing crossover with video games, internet gaming disorder, social media consumption, and gambling disorder. Someone may watch others play online video games excessively, maybe they don’t spend their own money, but they’re watching a slot machine simulator. Is that a gambling disorder? A gaming disorder? A social media use disorder? You can see how making these diagnostic distinctions gets messy, and it’s unclear how important those distinctions are clinically.",
		"Dr. Fong: Lifetime prevalence of gambling disorder hovers around 1% to 2% of the general population. And there is significant geographic variability. For example, 12-month prevalence can be as high as 3%–6% in some areas or as low as 0.1%–1% in others (Abbott MW, Public Health 2020;184:41–45). The prevalence is similar to bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. That’s a lot more common than most people realize. Why? Because people rarely like to talk about it. Has a patient ever come to your office with the chief complaint, “I gamble excessively, and I need help to stop”? Probably not. And I think that’s because of how we view money as a society. It goes all the way back to the morals and principles that this country was founded on. Back then, gambling was viewed as a vice and a sin but also as a way of escalating your future fortunes. So, these perceptions run very deep. People with money are seen as successful. And if you lose money, you’re not only a loser financially, but maybe character-wise too.",
		"Dr. Fong: The risk factors are like those we see for SUDs. Breaking it down along the lines of the biopsychosocial model is not only useful conceptually but can help create a treatment roadmap for individual patients. Look at their risk factors and use that to identify fruitful areas to intervene. There are genetic risk factors (Slutske WS. Genetic and environmental contributions to risk for disordered gambling. In: A. Heinz N et al, eds. Gambling Disorder. Cham, Switzerland: Springer Nature; 2019). Head injury is a potential risk factor. So is taking certain medications, particularly dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole and ropinirole) or partial dopamine agonists (such as aripiprazole). Many psychiatric conditions are associated with gambling disorder—particularly depression, bipolar disorder (BD), ADHD, SUDs, and antisocial personality disorder. Interestingly, even dementia is associated with gambling disorder. It may seem surprising at first, but it makes sense when you think of some of the psychological factors that drive the disorder, namely impulsivity and impairments in attention, focus, and cognition (Moreira D et al, J Gambling Studies 2023;39(2):483–511). The gambling industry are aware of this; we’ve all seen those buses bringing in older adults, many of whom are probably cognitively impaired."

     Topic : Gambler Traits
     <Quotes>
"CATR: Other than other addictions, what are some other patient factors or comorbidities that are associated with gambling disorder?
Dr. Fong: So, we think about bio-psychosocial risk factors. So, we first think about what are some of the risk factors that create gambling disorder? And it’s going to be very similar to the risk factors that we see for substance use disorder. So, biologically you’re going to have genetic risk factors. Biologically, you’re going to have certain medications like dopamine agonists that could potentially raise your risk of developing a gambling disorder. Head injury certainly has been shown to be a potential risk factor. 
Psychological risk factors for developing gambling disorders are, of course, untreated psychiatric conditions and any of them – but particularly depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorders. The disorder that primarily have issues of impulsivity, attention, focus, cognitive impairments. Ironically, even having dementia. And you think about all the casinos that bring older adults on buses that may have cognitive impairments while they’re gambling. You know, the dementia in the cognitive impairment is a risk factor for gambling disorder. Think about how sophisticated and complicated these slot machines are in the 21st century with 5x5 matrices. Very complicated stuff.
So, that’s a psychological...the other things about personality traits – again, yes. Someone who’s risk-taking, someone who’s sensation-seeking, someone who’s very competitive. But also, and people don’t recognize this – people who don’t do well with loss. People who have lower degrees of grit and resilience. People who have spectacular need for success. People who really struggle with loss aversion. People who just don’t do well when they don’t win. People who have – I don’t have a psychological term for FOMO (fear of missing out), right? But that’s definitely a risk factor for a lot of folks who develop a gambling disorder. They have this intense – almost obsession about missing out on opportunities to win money that drivees ongoing gambling which ultimately drives more problems.
And lastly, social risk factors, of course, are going to be things like availability, access, who’s gambling around you? Who are your friends? Who are you peers? We’ve done a lot of work looking at elevated risk of gambling in Asian-American [00:20:00] communities and in part, because the social entertainment of gambling is the fabric of what they do. The casino buses, the high propensity of the family and friends to gamble together, almost the intense peer pressure to gamble. These are all things that can happen that can drive up one’s risk.
So, like any other addiction, biopsychosocial – and I use that roadmap for any of our psychiatrists working with patients to say identify the biopsychosocial risk factors, then you will then identify your biopsychosocial treatments that you need for your patients.

		"Dr. Fong: People who develop gambling disorder are more likely to engage in high risk and sensation-seeking behaviors and are very competitive (Rogier G et al, Scandinavian J Psychology 2020;61(2):262–270). Also, and this may seem counterintuitive, people who don’t do well with loss—there’s higher risk in those with lower degrees of grit and resilience. I don’t have a good psychological term for this, but it’s captured in pop culture these days with the term “FOMO,” or “fear of missing out.” Many people with gambling disorder have an intense aversion to missing out on opportunities, in this case, to win money. It’s this aversion that drives ongoing gambling, even when it’s causing problems.",

		"Dr. Fong: This has to do with availability, access, and who is gambling around you. Is gambling prevalent in your community? Do your friends gamble? We’ve done work examining elevated levels of gambling in Asian-American communities because the social entertainment of gambling is woven into the fabric of their society (Alegria AA et al, CNS Spectr. 2009;14(3):132-142). For example, there is at least anecdotal evidence that casinos market more to certain Asian-American communities, raising participation rates and social acceptance of gambling as a community activity (Keovisai M and Kim W, J Gambl Stud. 2019;35(4):1317-1330)."

	Topic: Gambling Treatment ,
	<Quotes>	
	"CATR: So, that brings up treatment. What are the treatment options and what do these entail? And when might you recommend one treatment over another?
Dr. Fong: So, the year’s 2023, and I began doing gambling work in 2002, so it’s been about 20 years. On one hand we have a lot of new advancements. On another hand, we’re still using the same stuff we used 20 years ago. So, biopsychosocial treatments. Under the biological treatments, we do not have [00:25:00] an FDA-approved treatment for gambling disorder and I don’t believe we’ll get one in the next 10 to 15 years. It’s very expensive to bring one to market, right? But that doesn’t mean that medications are not effective.
We have had a number of medications in clinical trials that seem to work pretty well in the laboratory setting and pretty well in the clinical setting. Those are opioid antagonists like Naltrexone, Nalmefene (which is not available in the United States). Although it is available (Nalmefene) now in the United States as an opioid overdose reverser. That’s brand new. I think May, 2023. We’ve also looked at other things like n-acetylcysteine as kind of a neuromodulator as potentially reducing some of that impulsivity.
But unfortunately, most of our medication trials have not proven to be very successful in terms of having a big difference between placebo and medications; and those include SSRI’s, Depakote, antipsychotics like olanzapine, modafinil, stimulants and things like that. So, my medication strategy tends to be naltrexone for gambling clients that have that very positive rewarded experience, the urges, the craving, the butterflies in their stomachs.
I’ll also use medication to treat the co-occurring disorder that might be driving the gambling. A perfect example, you have ADHD, and you don’t treat that and then gambling disorder on top of that. You treat the ADHD with stimulants. The gambling disorder also reduces there.
There have been some folks looking at TMS now, some folks looking at varenicline. Others have said even other anti-addiction medications potentially could be of worth, such as Acamprosate and Ondansetron. But none of those have risen to the level of really strong clinical data that’s supported by laboratory data. So, for me Naltrexone mainly for the rewarding and treating the co-occurring psychiatric disorder. That’s a biological treatment.
Psychological treatments, we know that there’s essentially 15 different kinds of psychotherapies have been researched and tried for gambling disorder, including motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, supportive therapy. And they all work! They all work very well. And like other addicted disorders, the theme is the same. The longer patients stay in treatment, the better they do.
Dr. Nancy Petry, a pioneer in gambling treatment disorder, she’s out there from Connecticut. She’s written several wonderful books on treatment. She’s also pioneered cognitive behavioral therapy for gambling disorder. Also, a very short one or two sessions of brief behavioral therapy for gambling disorder. So, that’s very effective.
And under the social treatments and support, of course, Gamblers Anonymous remains a very critical component of the treatment plan. It cannot be the only part and I think too often people make that mistake. Oh, go do 90 meetings in 90 days. Or just go to GA. And they neglect the importance of doing the psychotherapy or medication support or the other psychiatric things that we do very well at. 
So, oftentimes what will happen when patients come in to UCLA into our treatment program, we’ll do an hour of intake. We’ll do 45 minutes of history gathering, and we’ll spend 15 minutes gong over the treatment plan. The treatment plan that we describe is based off SAMHSA’s models of recovery where we focus on the domains of home, physical health, mental health, sense of purpose (slash) usefulness, and community. So, one could argue these are all psychological framing treatments where we embed the biological treatments, and the social treatments really to create a domain of recovery. 
Home, health, purpose and community. And ironically, oftentimes when med students watch us do the work, they’ll say “when do you get to the gambling?” “When do you tell them how to stop gambling?” “When do you tell them how to deal with urges?” And ironically, what we’re focusing on first is really doing all those healthy practices that have been neglected or have not been done because of the addictive disorder. Correcting sleep, correcting nutritional, increasing physical movement, developing 2 to 3 new stress management techniques that you did not have before.
So, it’s interesting as I’ve gotten older, the recipe and things we do inside in the clinic has gotten more simple and it really focuses on identifying how hard it is for folks to stop doing a behavior that they’ve been doing for quite a long time that has brought them so much joy and so much pain. And when I think about that, that’s how I fold treatment into this idea of [00:30:00] physical, mental health, wellbeing first and then as you heal the brain, eventually the gambling will subside and fade away on its own.
That’s a long-winded answer but that’s some of our treatment approaches that we’re doing at UCLA and in the field of gambling disorder.
CATR: So, what about the non-expert? How do you recommend a general mental health provider or in some cases, even a primary care provider go about treating gambling?
Dr. Fong: Well, it starts with number one, recognizing that gambling disorder is a significant enough condition to merit asking about it. And then number two, just like any other specialty, you have to develop your treatment network. So, almost in every state in America there’s now state-funded treatment for gambling disorder where there are licensed therapists that are trained and receive extra training in gambling that can do that.
Here in California, our state program we provide 30 hours of training to licensed therapists about gambling addiction treatment and so, they have a lot of experience. A primary care provider can identify a client and then refer them into the network, and they can receive treatment by a specialist at no cost. If you’re a non-expert and you don’t have a lot of those resources in your state, we now have more and more online psycho-supported and online treatment programs for gambling disorder.
So, for instance there’s telehealth options. There’s a program called Kindbridge where it doesn’t matter what state you are in America, that you can then refer a client out and they can get telehealth treatment for gambling disorder. So, that’s great! I think for the non-expert that wants to treat gambling clients themselves, well, then get the training. Just if I wanted to treat obesity with some of the newer medications or if I wanted to treat diabetes I would go get additional training and I would go to conferences and do that.
So, there are gambling conferences that happen throughout the year that can give the non-expert from primary care to primary mental health to anywhere, just increase knowledge about gambling addiction. So, that’s number one. But I oftentimes emphasize what they should not do. So, some of the things you should not do in working with a client right away is number one, just don’t say “stop gambling.” That’s one of the biggest errors I see. Number two, I don’t recommend people saying again, just go to GA. They’ll fix it all. Again, GA is just one part of it. So, the non-expert when you’re saying just go to 12 step, that’s not enough. And you’re not – to me, that’s below standard of care in terms of recommending.
For non-experts, think of this as a specialty kind of condition. It is an addictive disorder and unless you have that specialty training, you have to build up your resources. I think a lot of times people are surprised at how many resources there are out there for gambling disorder that are essentially no-cost or available pretty quickly.
CATR: Do you have any specific recommendation for online resources or conferences?
Dr. Fong: Yes. There’s a bunch, so I’ll start with the online resources. I mentioned Kindbridge. They are a telehealth company with specialty in treating gaming and gambling disorder. Number two, there’s a software program called “Gamban,” which is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a software app you download to put on your phone or your laptop or your desktop and it blocks you from going on to the gambling website. 
So, it’s not meant to be a treatment in and of itself, but it’s just meant to lengthen the time from the time you log on to the time you place a bet and that’s a very low-cost option and for a lot of my patients, they say this is really been helpful because any time I get that urge and I go on and I can’t get on, it forces me to think, what am I doing here? Is this really what I want to do? So, that’s Gamban. Another online resource I would look at, of course, is there’s a number of growing online portals where you can get self-help workbooks.
Already you see like gambling studies program website, UCLAgamblingprogram.org. We do have an online, downloadable PDF self-help workbook where anyone who’s concerned about their gambling behavior can download it. They can review it at their own pace and start thinking about the changes they need to make, start thinking about the severity of their behavior. So, all that’s at no cost. 
For conferences, there’s really two major ones that happen. One is the National Council on Problem Gambling, which happens in every summer. And that’s probably the national leading conference on gambling treatment providers, advocates, policymakers all focusing on issues related to problem gambling. 
Secondly, there’s the National Center for Responsible Gambling that has a conference in the fall every year. More research-oriented [00:35:00] about the trends and the latest things in gambling research. And then, ironically (not ironically) many states have their own individual statewide conference. March is Problem Gambling Awareness Month. In California, we have an annual problem gambling summit every year that usually about one or two days where we present the latest in gambling treatment ideas and things like that. And nearly every state has that. Connecticut has that. New York has it. So, for a lot of the non-experts or folks who are unsure, go ahead and do an internet search for gambling conferences in your state and invariably, you’re going to find a lot of resources there. 
And, of course, Gamblers Anonymous with the pandemic has gone virtual. So, gamblersanonymous.org, as well as gamblersinrecovery is a separate website that lists all the 12-step and gambling support meeting. One of the really cool things about the gamblerinrecovery website, they list meetings that are happening throughout the world. I’ve had patients who logged on from LA and are attending and participating in virtual meetings with men and women from Europe. And talk about the whole spirit of connection, that’s exactly what it is. And a number of my patients have said we really like doing this. We’d rather do it with people who aren’t in our town, and we’d rather do it with folks who are very, very new and interesting. So, that’s an important resource to remember in 12-step support in person, as well as now the Zoom and digital platforms.
CATR: Are there sort of support resources for family members? 
Dr. Fong: Of course. And that would be Gamblers Anonymous (or GAMANON) has always been a companion to Gamblers Anonymous and likewise, they also have in-person as well as online support rooms. But, surprisingly, a lot of state programs also offer no-cost treatment for family members. California is an example. So, let’s say my wife is concerned about my gambling. She can call up the state program through 1-800-gambler and that’s a good national number – 1-800-gambler. And then she could then get access to it there because at no cost to her to help her deal with my gambling.
So, there are resources out there and it’s been built on the backs of we need to provide no-cost treatment because by the time people with gambling disorder enter treatment, you can imagine it’s pretty severe. In our state program, it’s essentially almost all DSM-5 criteria are met. In our state program, the average amount of money spent on gambling in the last year is about $25,000.00. High rates of substance use, high rates of emotional distress (quote) Curry disorder. Lots of emotional pain, drama and conflict and this is why it’s so critical for people to not only know the resources, but identify earlier on.
One of the biggest gaps in our field of gambling disorder treatment, how do we get someone who’s only had a few months of the condition or who are early on in their maybe two, maybe three or four of the DSM-5 criteria met, or limited damage – they still have a job, and they still have money. They haven’t done the really harmful things. How do we get them to enter treatment? Because invariably, the biggest difference between gambling and other addictions is the gambling is the one activity where you can actually win life-changing money.
You can actually make money that changes your station and your fortune. As an example, I had a patient a couple of months ago who relapsed and she won $80,000.00 and paradoxically, she came home with the money and that was the most difficult night for her. And it’s the one condition where suddenly, you do have life-changing money that if spent properly, could really make her life better. At the same token, imagine what that $80,000 did to her in terms of just triggering all the signs and symptoms of addiction and psychologically the damage it did for winning when you’re trying to stop the gambling behavior.
So, all that is going back to this concept of finding and recognizing there are dedicated treatment providers out there and that by identifying folks earlier in that condition, we can do a lot to really help people down the road. 
CATR: This is great. I think those are all of my questions. Anything that would be important to convey that we missed?
Dr. Fong: I think, again – your audience is mainly psychiatrists, right?
CATR: Yes.
Dr. Fong: One of the things I would highlight again [00:40:00] for the psychiatrists is that the prevalence of gambling behavior is much higher, roughly around 60% of the general population engaging in forms of gambling and we as psychiatrists, have the to now fall into our arenas really looking at how money impacts emotional and psychiatric help. Money. And I think that’s how it really modernizes. This isn’t just asking about another type of behavior. This is asking about how people relate to money.
As an example, one of the things that I focus on a lot in treatment is access to money. And part of the reason why people have gambling problems, they have too much access to money. Payday loans, online loans, things where people can get money very quickly and that’s when the harm comes. I’ve had so many patients come in, rack up debts very quickly in an online predatory loan and now that stress and the emotional pain from that loan is profound.
So, for psychiatrists, you know, where we’re really excellent in making those connections, when people are complaining about money or how they’re stressed about money, that immediately should raise our antenna about asking about gambling.
CATR: Okay. That’s really good information. Well, thank you very much. This was fantastic. Any housekeeping things to cover before we end?

	answers: [
		"Dr. Fong: There are no FDA-approved medications for gambling disorder, and I don’t believe we’ll get one in the next 10 to 15 years. Most of our medication trials have not proven very successful. So one of the principal uses of medications is to treat co-occurring disorders. But there is some evidence for the opioid antagonists naltrexone and nalmefene (just recently available in the US as an opioid overdose reversal agent) in higher doses and n-acetylcysteine. I’ve found that medications can be particularly useful for patients with biological reactivity. I’ll ask, “Tell me what it’s like when you’re driving to the casino. What are you feeling? What are you thinking?” Someone with high biological reactivity might say “I have butterflies in my stomach, my heart’s racing, my palms are sweaty.” There is work being done on other biological approaches such as rTMS, and other medications such as varenicline, acamprosate, and ondansetron. The data on these are either too early or too mixed to recommend them at this point. So, my biological approach usually boils down to naltrexone plus treatment of co-occurring psychiatric disorders.",

		"Dr. Fong: There are a lot of psychotherapy options, over a dozen in fact. We have evidence for motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, supportive therapy; they all work with similar effect sizes. Dr. Nancy Petry, a pioneer in gambling treatment, has developed a cognitive behavioral treatment specific for gambling disorder as well as a short one or two session brief behavioral therapy (Dowling et al, 2019). I mentioned that medication can be particularly helpful for patients with high biological reactivity. On the other hand, I tend to focus on psychotherapy for patients who describe dissociation. They might describe going to the casino as, “I go on autopilot, I don’t even remember how I got there.",
		"Dr. Fong: The longer I’ve been in this field, the simpler my approach has become; driven more by a whole-patient approach. I structure clinical conversations around SAMHSA’s four major dimensions that support a life in recovery: home, health, purpose, and community (https://tinyurl.com/2s7wt7dd). The initial goal is to re-establish healthy practices that have been neglected, such as sleep, nutrition, exercise, stress management. You must balance physical health, mental health, and general wellbeing. Otherwise, gambling disorder is going to be very hard to overcome.",
		"Dr. Fong: There are telehealth options available for those who don’t have good access locally. For those who struggle with online gambling, there’s a software program called “GamBan,” which is an app you can install to block gambling websites (https://gamban.com). It’s not a standalone treatment, but it removes easy access to gambling, and I find it gives patients an opportunity to pause and ask themselves: “Is this really what I want to be doing?” There are a lot of online portals and self-help workbooks out there. One I am affiliated with is the UCLA Gambling Program (UCLAgamblingprogram.org), and we provide downloadable PDF materials for free. For providers who are particularly motivated, I recommend the national conferences put on by the National Council on Problem Gambling and the International Center for Responsible Gambling. Most states host their own educational conferences as well.",
		"Dr. Fong: We haven’t discussed the importance of community yet, the importance of having a good treatment network. Peer support like Gamblers Anonymous (gamblersanonymous.org) and Gamblers in Recovery (gamblersinrecorvery.com) can be enormously helpful. It shouldn’t be the only component of treatment, but it can be a good adjunct. And almost every state funds a form of gambling treatment, oftentimes free of charge. For families, I’d recommend Gam-Anon, which is a companion to Gamblers Anonymous. And anyone can call 1-800-GAMBLER, which is a resource hotline that offers advice to people throughout the country."
